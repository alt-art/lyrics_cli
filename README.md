# Lyrics CLI

A very simple API wrapper that allows you to get lyrics from Genius.com. Barely 80 lines of code. Just a fun little project to get used to Rust.

This uses a publicly available API by [astridlol/lyrics](https://github.com/astridlol/lyrics)

## Installation

The best way is to install it using cargo.

```bash
cargo install lyrics
```

However, if you are on windows, you can download the binary from the [releases](/releases) page.

If you are on a Mac or Linux, please help other people by creating a binary for them and opening a new issue. Thanks!

## Usage

```bash
lyrics Never Gonna Give You Up
```
